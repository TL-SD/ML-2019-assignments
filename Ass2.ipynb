        "  Nowadays, with the development of IT technology, a large number of e-commerce websites have emerged, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Ebay and platforms providing other services such as Uber, Uber eats, etc. These new platforms combine traditional service industry with IT technology which has changed the way people live. \n",
        "Generally speaking, consumers often give their reviews and rating about services on these platforms. The reviews provided by users can help other customers with their decision, as well as provide important business information for the merchants for future improvement, so it is very meaningful for both customers and companies.\n",
        "E-commerce platforms often have a large number of reviews. It is impossible for enterprise managers analyze them one by one. Therefore, using machine learning to convert human language into machine-recognizable language, then providing statistical analysis of the result, can transfer the messy data into useful information efficiently.\n",
        "In this project, the data set we selected is the reviews provided by customers who purchased the mobile phone on Amazon. We first browsed the dataset to understand it, then chose the appropriate method for data preprocessing. After that we established models for converting the text into machine-recognizable data, and the classification algorithms would be used to construct the classifier models, so that the text reviews can be quickly converted into a quantifiable measurement index. Finally, we briefly summarized the experimental results and discussed the issues from an ethical perspective.\n"

At the same time, it can be seen that the number of characters in the comments have large difference from long to short, so it is necessary to select a classification model suitable for the text with various lengths. According to the online research, there are several models perform well for dealing this kind of classification, including Random Forest model, NBSVM model and LSTM neural network. Therefore, we plan to build the above three models and train them. \n",

        "The second model we built is the NBSVM model. NBSVM was introduced by Sida Wang and Chris Manning in the paper 'Baselines and Bigrams: Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classification'. In general, the Naive Bayers model performs better on short texts, and SVM performs better on long text processing. In this paper, the authors provide a new classifier that combines the traditional Naive Bayers and SVM models and experimented on different data sets, which is better than using one of the models alone. Therefore, the NBSVM model performs very well on combined text classification issues.\n",
        "To use the NBSVM model, we also divide the dataset into two parts, training data and test data, with a ratio of 0.3. At the same time, we remove the punctuaions from the text by using 're' library, then extract the term frequency, vectorize it through the TfidfVectorizer library. The NBSVM model construction part is provided by lrei on github. Finally we trains model with the processed training dataset then evaluates the prediction results."

        "The third model we built is the LSTM model. The LSTM model is a special RNN model. The traditional RNN model has long-term dependency problems when predicting long texts, that is, it cannot learn information which is far apart. The LSTM model internally adds filters to the information transmitted from the previous node, thus retains important information and 'forgets' unimportant information, in order to solve the problem of gradient disappearance and gradient explosion in long sequence training. It has a better performance in long sequence. \n",

        "We use the 'keras' library to build the LSTM model. First, the dataset is divided into training samples and test samples according to the ratio of 0.3. Then the 'tokenizer' function is used to convert the text data into a sequence, and then the 'pad_sequences' function is used to fill the converted sequence to the same length and convert them to a binary matrix.\n",

        "In the process of model construction, we added different layers to the LSTM model, including the processed matrix, the LSTM loop layer composed of storage units, the dense layer which is used to output the predicted attached an activation function suitable for the multi-class model. Then, the model was compiled with the loss function, optimization algorithm, metrics and other parameters. Finally, we use the train dataset to train the model and the prediction results were evaluated.\n",

        "After completing the training of the model, we input the dataset used for testing into the three models and obtain the predicted results. We use the 'accuracy' library to compare the predicted results with the real results, and visualize it. It can be seen from the above scores that the test results of the three models are similar, 0.706 for random forest, 0.71 for NBSVM and 0.697, respectively. At the same time, we also adjusted the parameters for each model. In the random forest model, we tested the number of different decision trees and finally selected 100 as a parameter. In the NBSVM model, we tested different penalty function C values and finally selected 0.05 as the penalty parameter. In the LSTM model, we tried to increase the epoch times, select different loss function and optimization algorithm, finally we chose the above parameters. If the epoch number is too large, it will lead to over-fitting, so we finally choose 5 as epoch number.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of the efficiency of the model, when the random forest is set to 100 trees, the model construction speed is slower. The fastest training among the three models is the NVSVM model. The construction speed are related to the parameters of the iteration and number of layers of the LSTM model. However, if the number of iterations is too large, it will lead to over-fitting.\n"

        "From the three graphs of the model prediction visualizations, we can see that the classification of 1 point and 5 points is mostly correct, because the corresponding consumers' attitudes and emotions are more obvious. At the same time, most of the false predictions appear between 4 points and 5 points. Considering the data set, it may be because the text reviews given by customers who scored 4 points and 5 points are similar, mostly positive reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "From the accuracy score perspective, the performance of the three models is comparable. It can be seen that all three models have the ability to deal with classification problems of reviews which mixed long and short texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Combined with the dataset, many customers have given high scores but may not have very positive feedback in the comments, vise versa. This part of the data will affect the accuracy of the model. In the data preprocessing section, if we can remove this part of the data training model, we may get more accurate prediction results."

        "Using machine learning to establish a natural language analysis model for automatic analysis and classification of user comments on shopping websites is just a small branch of language analysis using machine learning. Its technology can be applied to many other fields, providing great convenience for social and economic activities. But if its application is not well regulated and limited, it may also bring some ethical issues. Below we will use the utilitarian approach to analyse it specifically.\n",
        "Firstly, we need to identify the relevant stakeholders. Automatic analysis of user comments on shopping sites can have an impact on customers, sellers, shopping sites, and manufacturers. For sellers and commodity manufacturers, the natural language analysis model can help them deal with a large number of user reviews, save time and effort, and get the feedback they need to adjust the sales strategy in a targeted manner. For shopping websites, the natural language analysis model enables them to understand the needs of users better and make more personalized recommendations for users, thus achieving greater economic benefits. For customers, on the one hand, their feedback can be received more quickly and efficiently by the seller. But on the other hand, the processing of the machine can only simply classify the comments, and cannot understand the real needs of customers.  Moreover, to some extent, if natural language analysis is applied to all aspects of people's lives, then people's daily communication will be analysed by machine analysis. The machine extracts useful information from people's daily emails and texts, which is a big threat to the privacy of personal privacy. In short, in addition to potentially threatening people's privacy, natural language analysis models can provide people with a lot of convenience. Therefore, we must develop certain limits on its application while ensuring that it does not infringe on personal privacy.\n"
